# ðŸ“ˆ COVID-19 Global Data Tracker - Summary Report

## Overview
This project explores global COVID-19 trends using real-world data from [Our World In Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data). It covers time-series visualizations, vaccination progress, and country comparisons.

## Key Findings

1. **United States:**
   - Highest total reported cases and deaths globally.
   - Initial slow vaccine rollout but gained momentum in 2021.

2. **India:**
   - Steady rise in cases, major peaks in 2021.
   - One of the fastest vaccine rollouts among developing nations.

3. **Kenya:**
   - Relatively lower case counts and deaths.
   - Maintained a consistently low death rate.

4. **Vaccination Trends:**
   - By the end of 2022, the US and India had vaccinated over 60% of their populations.
   - Kenya had vaccinated approximately 30%.

5. **Global View:**
   - High case density in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia.
   - Lower totals in Sub-Saharan Africa and small island nations.

## Visual Assets
Plots and an interactive map can be found in the `/outputs` folder:
- `cases_over_time.png`
- `vaccinations_over_time.png`
- `death_rate_over_time.png`
- `world_choropleth.html`

## Next Steps
- Expand to include more countries or continents.
- Add more granular data (e.g., per 100k population).
- Perform correlation analysis across indicators.
